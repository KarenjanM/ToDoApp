## 1. CRUD functionality
CRUD functionality was done through Djangp REST framework using generics.
## 2.Frontend
Frontend was done using framework VUE js, which I find quite comfortable to use not going to far in frontend. And also big advantage is that all changes are instantly, which in combination with REST API on Django makes really great combination
